# Small internet monitor for system tray

My internet connection is spotty right now and I needed a way to know if is on or off at a glance. 
This small program pings 8.8.8.8 and displays a green or red circle in the windows system tray. 
After running, is necessary to change the windows system tray configuration so it always shows the icon.
Close it with right click.
